#Point Bake Demos
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/PointBake.png)

The NCCA PointBake format is a simple xml format for storing per vertex animation data, presented in these demos are maya scripts to export in the format and some demos to show how to load and visualise this data.


Note this branch is an older version and will not be maintained as it uses the old OpenGL widget
